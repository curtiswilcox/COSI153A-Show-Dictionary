### Reflection
- What you did well
  - I think I gave a decent demonstration of this project over Zoom. I was able to demo it live using my iPhone, which I think made the experience better than simply showing a movie or using the web-based approach.
- What you found challenging (if anything)
  - I did not find anything challenging for this CPA.
- What are the main features you want your app to have (when you finish it in December!)
  - I would like, at a very high level, the user to be able to select a show that they want to look into and then be able to see information about the show, such as a description of it and also information on all of its episodes. The episodic information would include, but not necessarily be limited to, the title and a summary of the episode, as well as its original airdate, the person or people who wrote [CPA 2 update: the information through here has made it onto the app!] and directed it, and view the characters that appeared in certain episodes (not a full cast list, but some of the more "main" or memorable characters, for better ease of finding an episode that one may be trying to recall). Ideally, the user could also mark some episodes as "favorite" to come back to later. I suspect that more ideas will come up as we are shown more and more things in class that I can then incorporate into this app.
