  - screen shots
  - developer notes (e.g. what technologies you are using, what packages your using, etc.)
- create a narrated movie in which you demonstrate that
  - your app meets all of the requirements (and highlight any that you haven't yet added)
  - that your app runs on a mobile device (or on a phone simulator, not a web browser)
