### Reflection
- What you did well
  - I hope I sound not terribly arrogant by stating that I think I did the project well as a whole. Google was, as it often is, my best friend for this assignment (insofar as suggesting other components to use (`Pressable`), not so much in terms of `react-native` bugs that had fairly useless error messages, or when something would work on the web but not on a mobile device).
- What you found challenging (if anything)
  - The aforementioned nigh-useless error messages were extremely frustrating. More than once, my code would be working just fine in the web and would not function properly on the mobile device simulator or my iPhone. Working around these error messages was the most difficult part of this assignment.
- What are the main features you want your app to have (when you finish it in December!)
  - I would like, at a very high level, the user to be able to select a show that they want to look into and then be able to see information about the show, such as a description of it and also information on all of its episodes. The episodic information would include, but not necessarily be limited to, the title and a summar of the episode, as well as its original airdate, the person or people who wrote and directed it, and view the characters that appeared in certain episodes (not a full cast list, but some of the more "main" or memorable characters, for better ease of finding an episode that one may be trying to recall). Ideally, the user could also mark some episodes as "favorite" to come back to later. I suspect that more ideas will come up as we are shown more and more things in class that I can then incorporate into this app.
