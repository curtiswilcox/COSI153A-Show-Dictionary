    "description": "Leslie Knope, a midlevel bureaucrat in an Indiana Parks and Recreation Department, hopes to beautify her town (and boost her own career) by helping local nurse Ann Perkins turn an abandoned construction site into a community park, but what should be a fairly simple project is stymied at every turn by oafish bureaucrats, selfish neighbours, governmental red tape and a myriad of other challenges. Leslie's colleague Tom Haverford, who delights in exploiting his position for personal gain, is as likely to undermine her efforts as to help her, while her boss, Ron Swanson, is adamantly opposed to government in any form, even though he's a bureaucrat himself.",

    "description": "The series takes place over 360 years in the future, with most episodes the first season set in the year 2384, in a futuristic metropolis known as Bay City. In the future, a person's memories and consciousness are written onto a disk-shaped device called a cortical stack, which is implanted in the vertebrae at the back of the neck. These storage devices are of alien design and have been reverse engineered and mass-produced but can only be made from the material on Harlan's world. Physical human or synthetic bodies are called \"sleeves\" and stacks can be transferred to new bodies after death, but a person can still be killed if their stack is destroyed and there is no backup. While this means anyone can live forever, only the wealthiest, known as \"Meths\" in reference to Methuselah, have the means to change bodies through clones and remote storage of their consciousness in satellites, so they never have to die of old age before being resleeved. Takeshi Kovacs, a political operative with mercenary skills, is the sole surviving soldier of the Envoys, a rebel group defeated in an uprising against the new world order. In the first season, set 250 years after the Envoys are destroyed, his stack is pulled out of prison by 300-year-old Meth Laurens Bancroft, one of the wealthiest men in the settled worlds. Bancroft offers him the chance to solve a murder\u2014Bancroft's own\u2014to get a new shot at life. In the second season, set 30 years later, Kovacs, now in a new sleeve, continues to search for his lost love and Envoy leader Quellcrist Falconer.",

Unknown to him, the island is actually the domain of a pod of mermaids, three of whom -- Sirena, Nixie and Lyla -- should be guarding the Moon Pool. But they neglect their duties, and Zac falls in. The waters of the pool endow Zac with special powers, allowing him to transform into a merman when he comes into contact with water and forcing the mermaid pod to leave the waters around the island. Not all of them leave, however; the three transgressors are cast out of the pod and left behind. To rejoin their community, the girls must somehow travel on land and retrieve Zac's new powers. If they fail, they'll remain outcasts forever. Zac enjoys his newfound abilities, and the girls are sympathetic. What's a mermaid to do?",

    "description": "The Addams Family are a close-knit extended family with decidedly macabre interests and supernatural abilities, though no explanation for their powers is explicitly given in the series. The wealthy, endlessly enthusiastic Gomez Addams (John Astin) is madly in love with his refined wife, Morticia (Carolyn Jones). Along with their daughter Wednesday (Lisa Loring), their son Pugsley (Ken Weatherwax), Uncle Fester (Jackie Coogan), and Grandmama (Blossom Rock), they reside at 0001 Cemetery Lane in an ornate, gloomy, Second Empire-style mansion, which is portrayed by the house at 21 Chester Place in Los Angeles. The family is attended by their servants: towering butler Lurch (Ted Cassidy); and Thing (also Cassidy), a disembodied hand that appears from within wooden boxes and other places. Other relatives who made recurring appearances included Cousin Itt (Felix Silla), Morticia's older sister Ophelia (also portrayed by Jones), and Morticia's mother Grandma Frump (Margaret Hamilton). Many guest stars who were mainly famous during the era came in the show playing a cameo part as the script permitted (for example, truant officer, insurance salesman, etc.). Much of the humor derives from the Addamses' culture clash with the rest of the world. They invariably treat normal visitors with great warmth and courtesy, even when the guests express confusion, fear and dismay at the decor of the house and the sight of Lurch and Thing. Some visitors have bad intentions, which the family generally ignore and suffer no harm. The Addamses are puzzled by the horrified reactions to their own good-natured and (to them) normal behavior. Accordingly, they view \"conventional\" tastes with generally tolerant suspicion. Almost invariably, as a result of their visit to the Addamses, a visitor only wants to leave and never come back.",

Kaz always tries to tell Tom about a secret code to play for real which Tom refuses to believe. While playing online Tom receives the special password. When he enters the password into his game scanner he is transported to a place called Chaotic that is able to take him to another world where the characters, locations and items in the card game came to life. There are two parts to the Chaotic world, Chaotic itself and Perim. Chaotic is where the people play an advanced version of the card\/online game where they transform into the creatures. The games can be watched via monitor by other players. The second part is Perim. In Perim the creatures, locations and items from the game are real. Players from the Chaotic game can teleport into Perim and scan the locations, creatures and items with their scanners, gaining the ability to use them in their game. There are four tribes in Perim. Two tribes, the Overworld and the Underworld, have been at war over a great power called the Cothica. Despite their names, there is no definite Good and evil tribe, as both have different stories and interpretations of how the war began, with each tribe seeing the other as being evil. The Danians and Mipedians have since joined the war, turning it into a four-way conflict over the Cothica. It is said that the Mipedians were once united with the Overworlders and the Danians united with the Underworlders. It is still unknown why they separated. Both Chaotic and Perim are made up of a mysterious code called the \"Chaotic Code\". The code is noted for constantly changing in random ways. Thus, it is considered \"chaotic.\" In Perim, the Chaotic Code describes everything. It contains the information for all the creatures, BattleGear, attacks, Mugic, and locations. The Cothica, mentioned above, is the source of all the codes in Perim. The code also describes everything in Chaotic. The BattleDromes, Transporters, and CodeScanners can analyze and\/or modify this code for matches, transport, or creation of virtual cards. When the players are in Chaotic\/Perim they exist simultaneously on Earth. When a Chaotic player leaves Chaotic they become one person again and the Earth version of the player gains the memories of anything they experienced in the Chaotic\/Perim world. This is awkward the first time they transport, as their online deck is blocked so that their Chaotic self can use it and their scanner becomes non functional, causing many people to believe they have broken their scanners until they are re-united with their Chaotic self.",

They find stones with the symbols for lightning, wind, and grass on them and a card with a picture of a Triceratops on it. The Triceratops that is later named Chomp is accidentally activated when Max rubs the card on the stone. The D-Team meet their new enemies in the Alpha Gang consisting of Dr. Z, Ursula, Zander, Ed, Seth, Laura, Rod, Helga, and the Alpha Droids. The Alpha Gang plans to obtain the Dinosaur Cards that were lost when their time machine exploded and stranded them in the present. Rex activated a Carnotaurus card which was named Ace and Zoe activated a Parasaurolophus which was named Paris. The D-Team and Alpha Gang often clash for possession of dinosaurs that are activated when their cards are activated. In the finale, Seth turns on his comrades with his Black Tyrannosaurus which is ultimately defeated. Seth attempts to bring Chomp back to the past which fails and Seth is sent into the past alone. The D-Team surrender their dinosaurs to Rex's original parents, with many tears. In the second series, the Alpha Gang and the Ancients return. While the parents are talking, they are kidnapped by Gavro, a member of the Spectral Space Pirates. This causes the Alpha Gang and D-Team to join forces against the Space Pirates in their plot to obtain cosmic jewels known as the Cosmos Stones. Seth later returns as an ally to the Spectral Space Pirates after they saved him from the time portal. Spectre, the leader of the Space Pirates, provides the dinosaur cards. In episode 75, Seth seems to become a traitor as he appeals to the D-Team for help saying that they forced him to help them. However, it was really a trick to get the two Cosmos Stones in D-Team's control, despite the fact that he attacks and defeats his comrades two episodes later. In the end although the Spectral Space Pirates manage to catch all seven Cosmos Stones, Seth and the Pterosaur defeat the Black Pterosaur. Rex, his parents, and the Alpha Gang leave to their own time as the Spectral Space Pirates are floating around in a pod.",

    "description": "Archer follows the exploits of eight dysfunctional secret agents of the International Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS), a fictional New York-based intelligence agency. They are Sterling Archer, the show's narcissistic, womanizing protagonist; Malory Archer, the retired agent-turned-ISIS director and Sterling's snarky, emotionally distant mother; Lana Kane, Sterling's love interest and mother of his infant daughter, and by far the most professional field agent at ISIS; Ray Gillette, the agency's openly gay bomb specialist; Pam Poovey, the head of the agency's Human Resources department who is often ridiculed by her peers; Cyril Figgis, a mild-mannered accountant-turned-agent; Cheryl Tunt, Malory's delusional, psychotic personal assistant; and Dr. Algernop Krieger, a bizarre, morally bankrupt scientist with little regard for the well-being of his subjects. The show features an array of supporting characters, several of whom gained expanded roles in subsequent episodes. Major supporting roles in Archer include Slater, an arms dealer and agent for the CIA; Katya Kazanova, head of the Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti (KGB) and Sterling's former love interest; and Barry Dylan, Sterling's archnemesis, who vows to kill him. Early seasons of Archer take place in an anachronistic, Cold War-esque universe (the exact period is intentionally vague). This, according to art director Neal Holman, allowed producers the freedom to \"cherry pick the stuff [they] like and ignore the elements that [they] don't.\" Yet in Archer's subsequent years, Reed developed new settings and character arcs, often with self-contained stories, as he explored new concepts for the comedy, much like an anthology. These seasons see the group attempt to complete a number of laborious tasks in highly unusual circumstances, generally to no avail, that involve sustaining an illegal cocaine operation to keep afloat, contract work for the CIA, and running a private, Los Angeles-based detective agency after being blacklisted from espionage by the US government. The show's eighth season, Archer Dreamland, transpires in Sterling's subconscious, reimagining the core cast as stock characters from a Gangland-era noir film set in 1947 Los Angeles. The ninth season, Archer: Danger Island, continues this arc as the characters are again re-envisioned as inhabitants of a remote South Pacific island circa 1939. The tenth season will be set in Archer's subconscious version of space. According to Reed, it will be a \"1970s vision of the future\" with nods to the \"prevalent aesthetic at the time\", featuring \"floppy disks instead of holograms, and \"xenomorphs\" of some description.\"",

Angel moves to Los Angeles, California, after it is clear that his doomed relationship with Buffy, the vampire slayer, cannot continue. During the majority of the show, he works as a private detective in L.A, where he and a variety of associates work to \"help the helpless\", restoring the faith and saving the souls of those who have lost their way.

Their one-upmanship comes crashing to a halt, however, when they learn that their husbands have fallen in love with each other and want to get married. As everything around the ladies is coming apart, the only thing they can really rely on is each other. This Netflix original re-teams Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin (\"9 to 5\") as Grace and Frankie, respectively, bringing their chemistry to the small screen. It's a casting reunion on a grand scale, as Tomlin is reunited with her co-star from \"The West Wing,\" Martin Sheen, who plays Grace's husband, Robert. And Fonda is back with Sam Waterston, her co-star from \"The Newsroom,\" who plays Frankie's husband, Sol.",

After abandoning his throne and retiring to Los Angeles, Lucifer indulges in his favorite things (women, wine and song) -- until a murder takes place outside of his upscale nightclub. For the first time in billions of years, the murder awakens something unfamiliar in Lucifer's soul that is eerily similar to compassion and sympathy. Lucifer is faced with another surprise when he meets an intriguing homicide detective named Chloe, who appears to possess an inherent goodness -- unlike the worst of humanity, to which he is accustomed. Suddenly, Lucifer starts to wonder if there is hope for his soul.",

Jack makes it clear to his class that he will not be teaching any biology. Realising he has a room full of honor-roll students at his disposal, Jack decides to use them for his own benefit: getting revenge on Miles. Eager to prove that he is still king of the castle, Principal Durbin (Patton Oswalt) struggles to keep Griffin under control. In its second season, Jack uses his students to find out how the people of Toledo find happiness in their daily routine, so as to mine information for what he believes will be a best-selling book.",
